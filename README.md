# ML_FINAL_PROJECT
This project, led by Federico Vargas, Andre Guichard, Exequiel, Jesus Lopez, Marco Raudales, serves as the final group project for the Master's in Big Data Science in the subject Machine Learning program at the University of Navarra. Leveraging advanced Machine Learning techniques, the project aims to develop system based recommendation models for classification, specifically targeting the classification of products for customers. The objective is to accurately classify customers based on their health-related attributes, enabling insurance companies to offer personalized insurance premiums. Through structured data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes, combined with real-world deployment strategies, the project aims to significantly contribute to insurance companies' ability to provide tailored healthcare coverage.

## Running the project

To run the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment with Python 3.10

You can use your preferred tool for creating virtual environments.

### 2. Install Poetry in the Virtual Environment

Follow the instructions at [Poetry Official Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) to install Poetry in your virtual environment.

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

Once Poetry is installed, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install all project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will read the pyproject.toml file and install all the dependencies required for the project.

### 4. Run Notebooks

With all dependencies installed, you are now ready to run any notebook in the project.
